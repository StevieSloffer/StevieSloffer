I'm Stevie.

I'm an automation and support engineer specializing in python-based automation, cost reduction, and world class support. I am devoted to utilizing skills and knowledge to make the lives of end users easier and more efficient, and make processes smoother and more straight forward. I am a specialist in rapid problem solving and triaging based on impact to business. I am committed to understanding the root of an issue and finding solutions that meet the needs of stakeholders. I am a Linux-first engineer who advocates for FOSS and believes in an open internet. 

**Languages**: Python, PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS, Java, C#, JavaScript<br/>
**Networking**: LAN + WLAN, DHCP, VLANs, TCP/IP, ACL/Firewalls, DNS, HTTPS/SSL, Web-Sockets, Webhooks<br/>
**Databases**: MySQL/MariaDB<br/>
**Operating Systems & Cloud**: Debian (primary), Ubuntu, Rocky Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS/PadOS, Google Cloud Platform, Proxmox<br/>
**Technologies**: Pfsense, LAMP applications, Git, IoT hardware, Omada SDN, Google OAuth2, Google Python API, 3CX, Freescout<br/>

I have spent hundreds of hours–from concept, to deployment, to thoughtful support & troubleshooting–building and maintaining solid, stable networks, tending to a collection of Linux VMs (and their firewalls and backups), and developing automation tools that improve efficiency and save on operation costs. Whether I am writing software to bring data to the finger tips of stakeholders, troubleshooting bothersome networking issues in retail environments, or coaching someone on a new technology, providing amazing support is always at the heart of my work. The tools I lean on most to administer great support are Linux (server & desktop), great relationships with my customers, Python, SQL, and reliable follow-through. 

While most of my work as been propriatary up until now, I am looking forward to beginning my entry into open source contributions.

I am interested in contributing to some software that I use daily, like [FreeScout](https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk). 

Projects I am proud of:<br/>
